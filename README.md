# Arduino_SpeedGame

This is a game with 3 buttons and 1 LCD screen.

You can see in my code the wireplan.

## Utilisation

You need to press the first button and press the second button as speedest as possible !
When you have do that, the time appears in the lcd screen.

By pressing the third button, you can see in the lcd screen the scoreboard but it don't really work :joy:

Special thanks to @Arnaulddev for his library nammed "TEMP".
